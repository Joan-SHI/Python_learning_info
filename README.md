## Python_learning_info

**Notes:** 

1. https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/
Had better go through "Opening a pull request"(in Section5) again when it suits.


2. "learn by doing" 
https://www.jetbrains.com/education/#lang=python&role=learner
Getting used to creating a virtualenv, installing the repo and running the unit tests.

:arrow_lower_right:day1: # Bring me back to Phase0 when I learned JavaScript through freecodecamp.  
:arrow_lower_right:day2: # Python is a beautiful language. (so far:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)   
:arrow_lower_right:day3: # Well I will remember Fibonacci Sequence for quite a while. I am at my stretch zone now, coding daily helps I guess.  
:arrow_lower_right:day4: # Variables, Strings, Data structures, Condition expressions, Loops, Functions, Classes and objects, Modules and packages, File input/output.     
:arrow_lower_right:day5: # I need more time to digest self parameter/variable in Python.    
:arrow_lower_right:day6: # Finish 'introduction to Python3' today. I enjoy 'Python Tutorial' in w3schools.com too.

3. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ or alternative approach:

Install a Python IDE (PyCharm CE:  https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ ) and turn on the inspection for PEP-8 (see https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2013/02/long-awaited-pep-8-checks-on-the-fly-improved-doctest-support-and-more-in-pycharm-2-7/ for instructions on how to enable this in PyCharm).  Then, it's just a simple matter of opening files and looking for red squigglies.

4. Todos:

- https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.lib.py/issues/145 - Reformatting the code so that it conforms to PEP-8 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).  At this point, all of the main code has been converted; only the unit tests need to be reformatted.  

- https://github.com/eflglobal/filters/issues/16 - easy to implement, quick to write tests for; the hardest part is learning about unicode normalisation.

- https://github.com/eflglobal/filters/issues/28 - filters is a really fun library (IMO), and it's very, very testable.

- https://github.com/eflglobal/filters/issues/33

- https://github.com/eflglobal/filters/issues/41

- https://github.com/eflglobal/filters/issues/40 (Definitely a stretch issue)
